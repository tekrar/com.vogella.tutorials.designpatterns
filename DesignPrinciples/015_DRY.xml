== DRY Principle
	Dry is a shortcut for "Don't repeat yourself". For software it
		means that it is good to rely on good libraries to achieve a certain
		functionality rather than implementing it once again.
	
	So the first good step is to look for existing solution for a
		certain problem.
	
	The other part is to implement the code in an abstract manner so
		that it can be reused by others, who might face not exactly the same
		issues, but similar ones.
	
	An example could be the creator of a file dialog, which might
		just wanted to open particular files, but implemented it in a way so
		that it is able to handle any file.
