== Builder

=== Definition
		
			<emphasis>
				The builder pattern provides a build object which is used
				to construct a complex object called the product. It encapsulates
				the logic of constructing the different pieces of the product.

=== Example
		
			Typically the builder pattern is implemented by an class which
			has
			several methods to configure the product. These methods typically
			return the builder object, this allows to use the builder via a
			fluent API, e.g, by calling methods directly after each other. Once
			the product is
			completely configured a
			`build()`
			method is called to construct the object.
		
		Assume you have a data model like the following.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/Task.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		Before Java 8 your builder would looks like the following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/TaskBuilder.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		And here is how you can use it.
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="./examples/MainTest.java" />
			</programlisting>

=== Evaluation
		
			The builder pattern simplifies the creation of objects. It also
			simplifies the code as your do not have to call a complex constructor
			or call several setter methods on the created object.
		
		The builder pattern can be used to create an immutable class.
