== The adapter pattern

The _adapter pattern_ converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expects. 
This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
	
The adapter pattern is widely known in software development and used in many programming languages, e.g., Java.

Adapter allows to reuse existing coding without changing it, as the adapter ensures the conversion between the different interfaces.
	
In comparison to a _decorator pattern_, the adapter pattern only converts interfaces, while the decorator pattern adds new functionality to an existing interface. 
Therefore, the decorator does not change the existing interface.
