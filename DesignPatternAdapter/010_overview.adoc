== The adapter pattern
	
The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class
into
another interface the clients expects. Adapter lets
classes work
together that couldn't otherwise because of
incompatible interfaces.
	
The adapter pattern is widely known in software development and
used in many programming languages, e.g., Java.
This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one, which
usually means that the actual object is wrapped by
another
object, so
that it fits to another desired interface.
	
Adapter allows to reuse existing coding without changing
it. The
adapter makes the conversion between the different
interfaces.
	
In comparison to a decorator pattern, the adapter pattern only
converts
interfaces, while the decorator pattern
adds new
functionality to an
existing interface. Therefore the
decorator does not change the
existing interface.
